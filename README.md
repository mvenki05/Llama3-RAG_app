# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) App

This project is a demonstration of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The app integrates retrieval techniques with language models to enhance the generation of accurate and contextually aware responses. It is designed to query large datasets or knowledge bases to retrieve relevant documents, which are then used to guide the generative model in producing more informed outputs.

## Features

- **Document Retrieval**: Retrieve relevant documents based on user queries.
- **Augmented Generation**: Use retrieved documents to generate more accurate and contextually aware responses.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and modify for different retrieval strategies or generative models.

## Notebooks

- `RAG_app.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates the core functionalities of the RAG system, including document retrieval and response generation using a pre-trained model.


## Usage

1. **Input Query**: Provide a query to retrieve relevant documents from the dataset.
2. **Generation**: The retrieved documents will be passed to the generative model to provide an informed response.
3. **Customization**: Modify the retrieval method or the underlying model as needed to suit your application.

## How It Works

1. **Document Retrieval**: Uses a pre-trained retriever model to search for documents based on a user query.
2. **Response Generation**: The retrieved documents are fed into a language model (such as GPT) to generate a response that incorporates the retrieved information.

## Future Improvements

- **Dynamic Dataset Integration**: Allow for dynamic switching between different datasets.
- **Improved Model Performance**: Experiment with different retrievers and generative models to improve response accuracy.
- **Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune both retrieval and generation models for domain-specific use cases.
